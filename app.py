        ## üåü Why PsyReport?
        Children's drawings offer deep psychological insights, revealing their emotions, personality traits, and mental well-being.
        PsyReport is an **AI-powered psychological analysis tool** designed to interpret children's artwork through scientific methods.
        By analyzing drawings of **houses, trees, and people**, PsyReport provides valuable insights into a child's inner world.
        
        ## üéØ What Does PsyReport Do?
        - **üîç Emotional Analysis:** Detects hidden emotions such as joy, fear, anxiety, or stress in children's drawings.
        - **üßë‚Äç‚öïÔ∏è Mental Health Support:** Identifies early signs of emotional distress, aiding parents, teachers, and psychologists in providing timely intervention.
        - **üñåÔ∏è Personality Traits:** Assesses whether a child is introverted, extroverted, or experiencing emotional withdrawal.
        - **üìú AI-Powered Reports:** Generates insightful psychological assessments based on **deep learning and NLP models**.
        
        ## üöÄ How to Use PsyReport?
        1. **Select a Drawing Type:** Choose from House, Tree, or Person (HTP) analysis.
        2. **Upload or Create a Drawing:** Upload an image or use the interactive drawing canvas.
        3. **AI Interpretation:** Our advanced AI model analyzes the sketch for psychological patterns.
        4. **Receive a Detailed Report:** Get an AI-generated psychological analysis with professional insights.
        
        ### üî¨ Backed by Research
        - **HTP Test (House-Tree-Person):** A well-established projective test used in child psychology.
        - **Studies on Left-Behind Children (LBC):** Research highlights that LBC children often show emotional distress through artwork.
        - **AI in Mental Health:** Deep learning models significantly improve accuracy in psychological assessments of children's drawings.
        
        PsyReport bridges the gap between **psychology and AI**, offering a **scientific and compassionate** approach to understanding children's emotions.

    ### üß† **How House Drawings Reflect Children's Psychology**
    Children‚Äôs house drawings serve as a **mirror of their emotions, security, and social connections.** Research suggests that certain elements in their drawings reveal their emotional well-being:

    - üè° **Small, enclosed houses** ‚Üí May indicate **insecurity** or **feelings of isolation**  
    - üö™ **Locked doors, no windows** ‚Üí Could suggest **communication barriers or withdrawal**  
    - üé® **Bright colors, open doors, detailed surroundings** ‚Üí Show **confidence and social adaptability**  
    - üåë **Dark shading, broken roofs, isolated structures** ‚Üí Might reflect **stress or emotional distress**  

    Studies on **Left-Behind Children (LBC)** reveal that their drawings often depict **lonely or incomplete homes,** reflecting emotional struggles due to parental separation. **Analyzing these drawings helps detect stress, anxiety, or social tendencies,** aiding in early psychological support.
